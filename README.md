Final project: Data science and cross analysis techniques applied to peer-to-peer lending

Abstract: Among the technology innovations impacting the financial sector, "peer-to-peer"
(P2P) lending heavily relies on data analytics to operate successfully in competition
with established commercial banks. In my project I apply Data Science techniques
and methods to the publicly available loan book data set of UK P2P operator Zopa
to investigate features and extract patterns. I explore credit risk - which investors
face if borrowers do not to repay their loans - and successfully apply two different
classification models to predict the default probability. Additionally, I expand the
research by incorporating additional time series data for the UK inter-bank market
and investigating with simple signal processing if relationships exist between the
cost of funding for banks and P2P lending ("cross analysis").
